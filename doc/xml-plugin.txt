XML Edit                                        *xml-plugin.txt* *xmledit.vim*

A filetype plugin to help edit XML and SGML documents.

This script provides some convenience when editing XML (and some SGML)
formated documents. It allows you to jump to the beginning or end of the tag
block your cursor is in. '%' will jump between '<' and '>' within the tag your
cursor is in. When in insert mode and you finish a tag (pressing '>') the
tag will be completed. If you press '>' twice it will complete the tag and
place the cursor in the middle of the tags on it's own line.

Usage: Place this file into your ftplugin directory. To add html support
Sym-link or copy this file to html.vim in your ftplugin directory. To activte
the script place 'filetype plugin on' in your |.vimrc| file. See |ftplugins|
for more information on this topic.

Note: If you used the VIM 5.x version of this file (xmledit.vim) you'll need to
comment out the section where you called it. It is no longer used in the
VIM 6.x version.

Kudos to "Brad Phelan" for completing tag matching and visual tag completion.
Kudos to "Ma, Xiangjiang" for pointing out VIM 6.0 map <buffer> feature.

Known Bugs:
- < & > marks inside of a CDATA section are interpreted as actual XML tags
  even if unmatched.
- Although the script can handle leading spaces such as < tag></ tag> it is
  illegal XML syntax and considered very bad form.
- The matching algorithm can handle illegal tag characters where as the tag
  completion algorithm can not.

Mappings:
<Leader>x
	Visual - Place a custom XML tag to suround the selected text.

<Leader>.   or   <Leader>>
	Insert - Place a literal '>' without parsing tag.

<Leader>5   or   <Leader>%
	Normal - Jump to the begining or end tag.

OPTIONS							*xml-plugin-settings*

xml_use_xhtml
	When editing HTML this will auto close the short tags to make
	valid XML like <hr /> and <br />. Enter the following in your vimrc to
	turn this option on:
	    let xml_use_xhtml = 1
